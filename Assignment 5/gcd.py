Prompt: The greatest common divisor of two positive integers, A and B, is the largest
number that can be evenly divided into both of them. Euclidâ€™s algorithm can be
used to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two positive integers. You
can use this algorithm in the following manner:
a.  Compute the remainder of dividing the larger number by the smaller
    number.
b.  Replace the larger number with the smaller number and the smaller number
    with the remainder.
c.  Repeat this process until the smaller number is zero.
    The larger number at this point is the GCD of A and B. Write a program that lets
    the user enter two integers and then prints each step in the process of using the
    Euclidean algorithm to find their GCD.
    
Compute and print the greatest common divisor of two input
integers. and Use while loop.
